# Traffic Anomaly Detection

**Description:**

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting traffic anomalies in real-time. Using sensor data, camera feeds, or traffic logs, the system identifies unusual patterns in traffic flow, such as accidents, congestion, or other disruptive events. The model utilizes supervised learning techniques, anomaly detection algorithms, and deep learning to classify normal vs. anomalous traffic patterns.

## Features:
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Detect traffic anomalies in real-time using traffic data.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implementation of several machine learning and deep learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for better accuracy.
- **Visualization:** A user-friendly interface for visualizing traffic data and detected anomalies.
- **Dataset Handling:** Support for real-world traffic datasets, including sensor data, CCTV footage, and traffic logs.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
  - OpenCV (for camera feed analysis)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## Dataset:
